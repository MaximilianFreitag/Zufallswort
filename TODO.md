## To-Do list: (Things that I want to improve or add as a functionality)

- [x] Exchange the print() statements of each function with the return keyword
- [ ] If the maximum of possible words is exceeded make the function not display an error message but just the maximum of possible words. E.g. there not 1000 words with three F in it like in "Schifffahrt". This would lead to an error. (Use try...except...)
- [x] add a .yml file so that changes are uploaded automatically to pypi.org 
- [ ] Improve the quality of the duden.txt file... some words are either non-sense words or weird compound words like "Nachtfahrergesetz". There are also english words to get rid off.
- [ ] Add a function that only incorporates the 10.000 most popular words 
- [ ] Add a function that deals with stopwords (und, in, der, die,...)
- [ ] Create a function that only output nouns (Note to myself: nouns = Capital letter in the txt file) 
- [ ] Create a function that only outputs verbs 
- [ ] Create a function that only outputs adjectives 
- [ ] Add docstrings with a description of the function at the beginning of each function, if the user types in print(function_name.__doc__) the description/explanation will be displayed 

(Advanced)
- [ ] Add a function to output postive or negative words (sentiment analysis)
- [ ] Create a separate API with FastAPI for this library
